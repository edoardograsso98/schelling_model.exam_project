# University Project – Object Oriented Programming and Statistical Analysis with CERN ROOT

This repository contains the code and report for a university exam project. The assignment involved developing a model using Object Oriented Programming in C++ and performing an in-depth analysis of the results using advanced statistical techniques with CERN ROOT—a powerful framework developed for use in high-energy physics.

The project combined simulation and scientific data analysis, providing hands-on experience with both computational modeling and advanced statistical methods.
